# Solve difficult sudoku as a performance test for different programming languages

The work on this started in 2013 and IÂ´ve done it in a lot of programming languages since then.

The concept is a recursive algorithm that need as little memory as possible. 
It manipulates the field directly. The rules are made of arrays, so this solution is quite minimal.
I also make an obfuscated C version out of it. [sudoku_obfuscated.c](c/other/sudoku_obfuscated.c)

The tests ard made on macOs on macbook pro 15 from early 2013.
